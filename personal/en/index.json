There is now a version called \u0026ldquo;Experimental\u0026rdquo; which is my latest update. It adds features such as Ingress\nSome of the challenges has been to make Ingress work, which I believe is resolved now, but also to keep the file size low. The latest published version (0.3.0-alpha4) is using Python3 to save space.
